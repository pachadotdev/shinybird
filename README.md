# shinybird

A small package that  built with the idea of embedding Shiny apps in a website.

The idea is to provide a minimal top bar with tabs and navbar menus.

You can quickly change the colours and/or fonts (Google Fonts) with arguments such as 
`color = "red"` and/or `font = "Roboto Slab"`, or you can pass a custom CSS file to the Shiny app.
